# :computer: Default Host Management Configuration (DHMC) Enabler

## üß† Rationale

The [Default Host Management Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/managed-instances-default-host-management.html) (DHMC) is an AWS configuration at regional level and a best practices for managing Amazon EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager. It helps you streamline the management of your EC2 instances and maintain security compliance across your AWS resources.

DHMC provides a standard configuration for AWS Account, making it easier to implement and maintain systems management tasks, such as patching, software installation, sessions management, and configuration management.

This project aims to simplify the implementation of DHMC, ensuring efficient and secure management by setting the default IAM Role needed by SSM to work properly.
